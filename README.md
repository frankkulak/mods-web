# mods-web (mods.frankkulak.com)

This website provides a collection of mods I make for The Sims 4, and provides links to download them from.

I built it with the help of Vue.js, Bootstrap, and Sass, and I host it right here on GitHub. I'm a self-taught web developer, so any suggestions you have to improve the quality of this website and its code are very welcome!

Due to my own hardware limitations, I am only able to test this website with Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on macOS and an iOS simulator before updates are released. I try to be as mindful of browser compatability as possible*, but bugs sometimes sneak through - if you experience anything weird, please let me know by emailing me or submitting an issue!

* = Please note that I am aware that I do not currently support Internet Explorer. I plan to integrate Babel at some point to increase compatability.
