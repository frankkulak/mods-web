# mods-web (mods.frankkulak.com)

This website showcases the mods I create for The Sims 4, as well as links to download them.

It is built with Vue.js, Bootstrap, and Sass. It is served from the `gh-pages` branch of this repository. I'm a self-taught web developer, so any suggestions you have to improve the quality of my website and its code are very welcome!

Due to my own hardware limitations, I am only able to test this website with Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on macOS and an iOS simulator before updates are released. I try to be as mindful of browser compatability as possible, but bugs sometimes sneak through - if you experience anything weird, please let me know by [emailing me](mailto:me@frankkulak.com) or [submitting an issue](https://github.com/frankkulak/mods-web/issues)!
