        <p>Patreon is a way to support creators in the form of a monthly pledge. You may either pledge $1 for general
            support, or join one of the higher tiers to enjoy early access to new content and personalized mods.
            The available tiers are described below, with their prices listed in USD. Prices may differ depending on
            your nation's currency.</p>

        <b-row align-h="around" class="mt-5">
            <patreon-tier name="The Pancakes" cost="2" :benefits="[betas]"/>
            <patreon-tier name="The Goths" cost="4" :benefits="[betas, alphas]"/>
            <patreon-tier name="The Landgraabs" cost="8" :benefits="[betas, alphas, customMods]"/>
        </b-row>

        <section-header text="what do the benefits mean?" class="my-5"/>
        <p><span class="benefit-title">Early access to betas.</span> Betas are feature-complete versions of new mods and
            updates. They are released to patrons 2-3 weeks before the public, depending on whether any issues need to
            be fixed or not.</p>
        <p><span class="benefit-title">Early access to alphas.</span> Alphas are incomplete snapshots of new mods and
            updates while they're being developed. While I hold them to the same standard of quality as betas and public
            releases, they may be missing some features and contain more bugs. Giving feedback and reporting issues
            about alphas helps me make betas and public releases the best they can be.</p>
        <p><span class="benefit-title">Personalized mod versions*.</span> If you want any small tweaks made to any of my
            mods, I will create a custom version just for you. I will keep your version up-to-date with the latest
            version of the mod, and fix any issues that arise with patches. If you cancel your Landgraab pledge, I will
            no longer update your custom version.</p>
        <p class="mt-5">* = These requests must be reasonable in scale, and not all can be fulfilled. If youâ€™re unsure
            if your idea is reasonable, ask me <a href="https://discord.gg/qNhD3Jh" target="_blank">on Discord</a>
            in the #patreon-questions channel before signing up.</p>
