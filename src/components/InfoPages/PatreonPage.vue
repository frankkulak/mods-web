        <p>Patreon is a way to support creators in the form of a monthly pledge. You may either pledge $1 for general
            support, or join one of the higher tiers to enjoy other benefits. The available tiers are described below,
            with their prices listed in USD. Prices may differ depending on your nation's currency.</p>

        <b-row align-h="around" class="mt-5">
            <patreon-tier name="The Pancakes" cost="2" :benefits="[betas]"/>
            <patreon-tier name="The Goths" cost="4" :benefits="[betas, alphas]"/>
            <patreon-tier name="The Landgraabs" cost="8" :benefits="[betas, alphas, customMods]"/>
        </b-row>

        <section-header text="what do the benefits mean?" class="my-5"/>
        <p><span class="benefit-title">Replacement benefits.</span> These "benefits" are in place of the old alpha/beta
            early access benefits, which have been removed due to <a
                href="https://help.ea.com/en-gb/help/the-sims/the-sims-4/mods-and-the-sims-4-game-updates/#policy"
                target="_blank">EA's new policy</a>. These benefits offer nothing at the moment - keep an eye out for
            the new benefits I come up with.</p>
        <p><span class="benefit-title">Personalized mod versions*.</span> If you want any small tweaks made to any of my
            mods, I will create a custom version just for you. I will keep your version up-to-date with the latest
            version of the mod, and fix any issues that arise with patches. If you cancel your Landgraab pledge, I will
            no longer update your custom version.</p>
        <p class="mt-5">* = These requests must be reasonable in scale, and not all can be fulfilled. If youâ€™re unsure
            if your idea is reasonable, ask me <a href="https://discord.gg/qNhD3Jh" target="_blank">on Discord</a>
            in the #patreon-questions channel before signing up.</p>

        <b-alert show dismissible class="no-ea-alert mx-2 mb-4 mt-5">
            <p>Hey there! Since early access benefits have been removed, most tiers are now for general support only. If
                you want a refund for the current month of one of these tiers, please reach out to me and I will grant
                it - no questions asked.</p>
            <p>The only exception is Landgraab patrons who have received a personalized mod version - no refunds will be
                issued if you have already received this benefit.</p>
